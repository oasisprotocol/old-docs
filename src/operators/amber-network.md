# The Oasis Amber Network

## What is it?
With the [QuestNet](./the-quest-rules.md) reaching a point of stability, the Amber
Network is the next phase of the Oasis Network’s path to Mainnet.
The Oasis Amber Network is a release candidate for Mainnet and
includes all the core features of the network you can expect
at Mainnet launch.  This includes:
 
* Fully decentralized consensus layer
* Staking and delegation
* Commission management for node operators
* Consensus committee with up to 70 validators
* Multiple ParaTimes (parallel runtimes) running compute on
the network (expect more and more added over time)

##Timing

The Amber Network will kick off in mid-June. We will share the specific start date on June 11. 

## What’s the goal of this network?

This network is intended primarily for node operators
who won tokens in The Quest as a means to do a final test of the
Oasis Network code before the Mainnet launch. Very small grants
will also be awarded to individuals who want to test hardware wallets.

## Joining the Amber Network as a node operator

In order to join the Amber Network, you will need AMBER test tokens.
*(Note: AMBER tokens are test tokens used specifically for this network).* 
Unlike in the QuestNet, there is no faucet to distribute tokens, so instead you
can get stake needed to run your node in two ways:
* **Genesis Block**: In the genesis block of the Amber Network, node operators
will be allotted the total amount of tokens they’ve previously earned from
the Oasis QuestNet or via other means (fulfilled grants, etc). You will
be able to find that amount here after The Quest ends on June 4.
* **Delegation** from the Oasis Protocol Foundation and Oasis Labs
(primarily for testing purposes)

Incentives for the Amber Network will be based on this community-proposed
incentive model and include a few parameters specific to this Network.

## Submitting your entity for the genesis block

To ensure that your node is in the genesis block, we will ask that you
submit a new entity package no later than Monday, June 15.
Note that even if you’ve submitted an entity package in the past,
you need to regenerate and submit a new one.

Entity package instructions can be found [here](docs.oasis.dev).

## Incentives

The Amber Network will be used as a way to provide bonuses in the
form of delegation from the Oasis Protocol Foundation in the forthcoming Mainnet. The Oasis Protocol
Foundation will plan to delegate up to 50% of its available tokens based
on successful completion and staking reward rankings from the Oasis Amber Network as well
as availability rankings and overall track record. **(NOTE: Delegation is
contingent on commission rates that are no more than +/- 10% of the 
weighted median network commission rate)**

## Wallet testers needed

More on this to come soon.
