# Rules and Guidelines for The Quest: Round 1

![The Quest](/operator_images/the_quest.png)

Welcome to The Quest -- a multi-round staking competition (aka incentivized
testnet) run on the Oasis Network.

***[Sign up][sign-up-form] for the competition today!***

## Overview

Below are a set of guidelines that we hope will help you prepare for the
competition. These guidelines are a framework for how we’re thinking about Round
1 of the competition. We expect this to span anywhere from 1-2 months in time.

### Goal of The Quest

We hope to use a staking competition to do a few things:

1. Stress test the beta version of the Oasis Network before it Mainnets and give
   feedback on what’s working - and what’s not.
2. Give operators a chance to test drive the network and their setups.
3. Give a diverse group of operators an opportunity to earn rewards that can be
   used to stake on the Oasis Network Mainnet.
4. Expand and further empower a community of data privacy advocates around the
   Oasis Network.

### Eligibility for the Competition

We’ve received a number of questions about who can join, and we want to be as
explicit as we can. We want to have as diverse and broad a community of node
operators as possible. That said, citizens and residents of certain
jurisdictions may not be eligible to receive rewards due to legal requirements.
Your participation and eligibility to receive rewards are also subject to
**KYC** and depending on your country of residence **accredited investor
verification**. Before joining, be sure to read the official rules
**[here][eligibility-rules]**.

## How to Join

There are two basic steps to joining:

1. Set up a node on the Oasis Network today. Documentation of how to do so is
   [here][setup-docs].

2. [Sign up here][sign-up-form]. Note that you
   will need to sign a waiver as a part of this process. It is linked in the
   signup form.

## Competition Kickoff

The competition is expected to start **in early January**. We will give at least
5 day notice to start time so everyone has plenty of time to prepare.

The competition will begin with a new genesis block that includes all
competitors to ensure each operator has access to funds at the same time. Each
operator will receive the same amount of test tokens to start the competition.

5 days before the competition starts we’ll reach out to get your preferred
public key. Please have this ready.

We will let additional entities join after the start of the competition.
This will put you at a disadvantage for the most blocks signed reward but could
still keep you in the running for best attack and most staked.

## Types of Challenges

The main goal of The Quest is to ensure that the Oasis Network -- and the
community that runs it -- are ready for a Mainnet launch. Our hope and plan is
that the challenges we’ve set forward align to this goal as well. Challenges
will vary in length and token rewards depending on what it is that is being tested.
Some more info below by length of challenge.

Before diving into your strategy for all items listed below, we also encourage
you to read through the [proposed incentive structure][incentives-proposal]
for the Oasis Network.

### Challenges Spanning the Entire Competition

* **Most Blocks Signed:** This reward will be given to the top 5 operators based
  on blocks signed. This will be announced at the end of the competition.
* **Best Attacks**: Best attacks is a qualitative reward but certainly one we
  will judge impartially. The goal of this reward is really to see if you can
  hack the system, steal someone’s tokens, cause a sybil attack, etc. Specific
  criteria we’ll consider when making our choice include:

  * Impact to other node operators
  * Impact to network stability

After the attack is complete, we ask you to write up your attack(s) (blog post,
github repo, etc) and submit it to us on the #attacks channel on [slack][slack].
The Oasis team will review and choose the top 5 attacks based on the criteria
above at the end of the competition.

### Time-based Challenges

Time-based challenges will focus on testing specific features and also
incentivizing early community coordination. To the extent we can, we’ll announce
these rewards in real time. Examples of these competitions include:

* **Most Stake**: We will run this for about a month of the competition. During
  this time delegation and transfers will be turned off. Staking will primarily
  be based on your ability to join the consensus committee for block rewards,
  transaction fees (we’ll submit transactions of synthetic data through the
  system at random times to test this) and your ability to hack and steal from
  others on the network. We will give a week’s notice before this portion of the
  competition ends.
* **System upgrades**: In order to test upgrades -- and community timeliness in
  supporting them -- we will likely incentivize a few specific upgrade cycles
  where all who upgrade in a given time period receive a token reward. Initially
  we’ll let you know when we’re doing this and may also do a bit more
  unannounced to keep everyone honest :).
* **Delegation**: For one upgrade we’ll plan to turn delegation on. We’ll do
  this after rewarding the most staked competition and will then ask people to
  stress test our delegation mechanisms. More on the challenge later.
* There may be more like the above. As they come we’ll share our plans and try
  to give you ample time to prepare.

### Other Challenges / Ways to Win Rewards

* **Best team player**: This reward is qualitative and will go to the team that
  is the most engaged and most supportive of the Oasis community during the
  competition. This could include running a seed node, troubleshooting on slack,
  and filing issues, among other things.
* **Community**: Rewards will be granted to the best community content producer.
  This could anything from a weekly blog recapping the competition to active
  social media engagement to The Quest swag designs, and more. Please be
  creative. **_NOTE: When you submit content or support via social media please
  use the hashtag #OasisQuest so we can see what you’re up to._**
* **Participation**: We also want to reward everyone who participates and
  engages in the network. To do this we’ll provide small rewards for the first
  30 nodes to join the network (starting when the public testnet launched) and
  participate through the end of the staking competition without double-signing;
  and for participation on the network for the entirety of the competition
  without double-signing.
* **[Grants][grants]**: There are a fair number of
  tokens put aside for [grants][grants]. If you
  have something you’d like to build, integrate, or add to the network that’s
  node and testnet related, please apply! We’re excited to see the network
  flourish and want to support those who are as well!

### Summary of Rewards

As a whole, the Foundation aims to allot ~1% of total tokens to the various
phases of The Quest, across challenge winners, community engagement awards,
grants, and more. Top rewards (although there may be more based on the
time-based challenges noted above) include:

**Attacks**:

* Best Attack: up to 1,000,000 tokens
* Top 5 Attacks: up to 500,000 tokens

**Most staked**:

* 1st place: 750,000 tokens
* Top 5 spots: up to 500,000 tokens

**Most blocks signed**:

* 1st place: 750,000 tokens
* Top 5 spots: up to 500,000 tokens

**Community**:

* Best team player: up to 100,000 tokens
* Community content: up to 100,000 tokens

**Participation**:

* All participants (who don't double-sign): 5,000 tokens
* First 30 entities on the network (who stay through the end with no
  double-signing): 10,000 tokens

## Communication

Throughout the competition there are a few specific ways that you can expect to
hear from us:

1. **Upgrades and big updates**: Please plan on checking [slack][slack] and join
   the [#nodeoperator](https://oasiscommunity.slack.com/archives/CMUSJCRFA) and
   [#nodeannouncement](https://oasiscommunity.slack.com/archives/CQK5NPXDX)
   channels.
2. **Weekly updates**: We’ll send a weekly update outlining what to expect in
   the following week and highlight any other questions/issues that have come up
   in the community. We’ll share this via email and slack.
3. **Weekly office hours**: We’ll host office hours every Thursday to answer
   questions in real time. Feel free to join as you see useful. We’ll also post
   all notes from those calls [here][office-hours-doc].
4. **Weekly leaderboard**: While we don’t have a block explorer just yet, as we
   get something up and running we will share out a weekly static leaderboard so
   you all have a sense of where each node stands in terms of stake and blocks
   signed. We’ll share this via email, slack and on our blog.

## Closing Ceremonies

The length of the competition will largely depend on how stable the network
proves to be, how active you all are, and what we learn about our incentive
proposal during this competition. So while we can’t share an end date today, we
can tell you that we’ll provide plenty of pre warning beforehand.
