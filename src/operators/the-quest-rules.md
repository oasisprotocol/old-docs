# Rules and Guidelines for The Quest

![The Quest](/operator_images/the_quest.png)

Welcome to The Quest -- a multi-round staking competition (aka incentivized
testnet) run on the Oasis Network. We are currently in the May Availability
Challenge of The Quest. **The May competition will start on May 11 at
4pm UTC.**

***[Join the Quest][get-set-up]***

## Overview

Below are a set of guidelines that we hope will help you prepare for the
competition.

### Eligibility for the Competition

We’ve received a number of questions about who can join, and we want to be as
explicit as we can. We want to have as diverse and broad a community of node
operators as possible. That said, citizens and residents of certain
jurisdictions may not be eligible to receive rewards due to legal 
requirements. 

**Your participation and eligibility to receive rewards are also subject 
to KYC and depending on your country of residence accredited investor
verification**. Before joining, be sure to read the official rules
**[here][eligibility-rules]**.

## How to Join

The Quest is now live but you can still join. Just follow these
steps to join the Testnet [here][setup-docs] and you will be
funded shortly afterwards.

::: tip NOTE
If possible, please use the same GitHub handle and email address
for any form linked in the docs.

### Goal of The Quest

We hope to use a staking competition to do a few things:

1. Stress test the beta version of the Oasis Network before it Mainnets and give
   feedback on what’s working - and what’s not.
2. Give operators a chance to test drive the network and their setups.
3. Give a diverse group of operators an opportunity to earn rewards that can be
   used to stake on the Oasis Network Mainnet.
4. Expand and further empower a community of data privacy advocates around the
   Oasis Network.

## Competition Start Time

The competition started on January 15 at 00:00 UTC, but you can still
join using the steps above. **The May Availibility Competition starts on May
11 at 4pm UTC**.

When you join, you'll receive the same amount of tokens to start the
competition as all nodes.

## Types of Challenges

The main goal of The Quest is to ensure that the Oasis Network -- and the
community that runs it -- are ready for a Mainnet launch. Our hope and plan is
that the challenges we've set forward align to this goal as well. Challenges
will vary in length and token rewards depending on what it is that is being tested.
Some more info below by length of challenge.

Before diving into your strategy for all items listed below, we also encourage
you to read through the [proposed incentive structure][incentives-proposal]
for the Oasis Network.

### Current Challenges
  
* **May Availability Challenge:** Availability is a measure of how well
  a node operator is performing. The May competition will run from May
  11 to June 4.
  
  For May, we define
  ``Best Availability (v3) = (Blocks Signed / Total Blocks) + (Blocks Proposed / Times Selected as Proposer)``,
  which requires, among other criteria, for the node to be online and (i)
  signing blocks and (ii) proposing blocks, including proposing blocks when
  another node fails to propose a block.
  
  The winners of the reward will be announced in early June.
  
  * **Best Attacks**: Best attacks is a qualitative reward but certainly one we
  will judge impartially. The goal of this reward is really to see if you can
  hack the system, steal someone's tokens, cause a Sybil attack, etc. Specific
  criteria we'll consider when making our choice include:
  * Impact to other node operators
  * Impact to network stability
  
  After your attack has been demonstrated, we ask you to write up your attack(s)
(blog post, GitHub repo, etc.) and submit it via this [form].

The Oasis team will review and choose the top 6 attacks (including one Best
Attack related to delegation and token transfer) based on the criteria above at
the end of the competition.
  
### Previous challenges:
 * **Blocks Signed:** As we introduce the Best Availability challenge, we will
    sunset the Most Blocks Signed challenge before we move on to the next phase
    of the competition, where delegation and transfers will be turned on. At
    that point, we will announce the top 5 operators with the most blocks signed
    as well as the special prize for most blocks signed from the nodes who
    joined after Jan 23, 2020.

 * **Most Stake**: We will run this for about a month of the competition. During
    this time delegation and transfers will be turned off. Staking will primarily
    be based on your ability to join the consensus committee for block rewards,
    transaction fees (we'll submit transactions of synthetic data through the
    system at random times to test this) and your ability to hack and steal from
    others on the network. We will give a week's notice before this portion of the
    competition ends.

### Other Ways to Win Rewards

* **Best team player**: This reward is qualitative and will go to the team that
  is the most engaged and most supportive of the Oasis community during the
  competition. This could include running a seed node, troubleshooting on slack,
  and filing issues, among other things.
* **[Grants][grants]**: There are a fair number of tokens allocated for
  [grants][grants]. If you have something you'd like to build, integrate, or add
  to the network that's node and testnet related, please apply! We're excited to
  see the network flourish and want to support those who are as well!
* **Community**: Rewards will be granted to the best community content producer.
  This could anything from a weekly blog recapping the competition to active
  social media engagement to The Quest swag designs, and more. Please be
  creative. **_NOTE: When you submit content or support via social media please
  use the hashtag #OasisQuest so we can see what you're up to._**
* **Participation**: We also want to reward everyone who participates and
  engages in the network. To do this we'll provide small rewards for the first
  30 nodes to join the network (starting when the public testnet launched) and
  participate through the end of the staking competition without double-signing;
  and for participation on the network for the entirety of the competition
  without double-signing.

### Summary of Rewards

As a whole, the Foundation aims to allot ~1% of total tokens to the various
rounds of The Quest, across challenge winners, community engagement awards,
grants, and more. Top rewards (although there may be more based on the
time-based challenges noted above) are below.

## Closing Ceremonies

The length of the competition will largely depend on how stable the network
proves to be, how active you all are, and what we learn about our incentive
proposal during this competition. So while we can’t share an end date today, we
can tell you that we’ll provide plenty of pre-warning beforehand.
